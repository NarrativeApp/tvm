 * \brief Determines a unique \p SEScope to hold the result of every Relay sub-expression.
 * This pass can be run multiple times, and can be run both before and after lowering.
 *
 * TODO(mbs): Rename SEScope |-> VirtualDevice, and use 'virtual device' (or just 'device')
 * throughout.
 *
 * We say a Relay expression E is 'on device D' if the result of executing E is stored on D.
 * We represent D by an \p SEScope, which means we can track anywhere from an arbitrary device
 * of some \p DLDeviceType to a specific memory scope on a specific (virtual) \p Device who's
 * code is compiled with a specific \p Target.
 *
 * Note that 'stored on device D' is almost but not quite the same as 'executes on device D',
 * see below.
 *
 * This pass works by collecting and solving device constraints, using defaulting heuristics to
 * resolve any remaining undetermined devices, and encoding the results on the output in a form
 * that's reasonably friendly to downstream passes.
 *
 * Specific \p SEScopes flow into the constraints from five places:
 *  - Existing "device_copy" CallNodes (with a \p DeviceCopyAttrs attribute) specify a
 *    'src_se_scope' and 'dst_se_scope' \p SEScope. Those constrain the argument and context of
 *     the call respectively. It is ok if source and destination devices are the same, such no-op
 *     copies will be removed after accounting for the device preference.
 *  - Existing "on_device" CallNodes (with a \p OnDeviceAttrs attribute) specify an 'se_scope',
 *    which constrains the argument of the call, but (usually, see below) leaves the context
 *    unconstrained. These are called 'annotations' in the rest of the code, have no operational
 *    significance by themselves, but may trigger the insertion of a new "device_copy" call by
 *    this pass. In two situations the result of an "on_device" CallNode may also be constrained
 *    to the given 'se_scope':
 *     - The "on_device" call occurs at the top-level of a function body, or occurs as an
 *       immediately let-bound expression. In this situation the extra degree of freedom in
 *       the function result and let-binding leads to surprising device copies, so we simply
 *       force the function result or let-bound variable to the given device.
 *     - The \p OnDeviceAttrs has an \p is_fixed field of \p true, which indicates we inserted
 *       it ourselves during an earlier invocation of this pass. This helps make this pass
 *       idempotent.
 *  - Some special operators require their arguments or results to be on the 'host' (typcially
 *    a CPU) \p SEScope, see below.
 *  - Any \p PrimFuncs in the \p IRModule (if \p LowerTEPass has already run) may constrain their
 *    argument buffers to have a specific memory scope, which is part of \p SEScope.
 *  - Annotations left over from a previous run of this pass, such as 'param_se_scopes' and
 *    'result_se_scope' function attributes we introduce below. This is so the pass is idempotent
 *    and can be re-run to flow additional memory scope constraints.
 *
 * We proceed in four phases:
 *
 * Phase 0
 * -------
 * We rewrite the programs to handle some special cases:
 *  - "on_device" calls at the top-level of function or immediately let-bound are rewritten
 *    to have \code is_fixed=true \endcode.
 *  - We wish to treat \code on_device(expr, device_type=d).0 \endcode as if it were written
 *    \code on_device(expr.0, device_type_d) \endcode. I.e. we prefer to copy the projection from
 *    the tuple rather than project from a copy of the tuple. We'll do this by rewriting.
 *  - We are prepared to insert device_copies on the arguments and result of calls to PrimFuncs,
 *    on the assumption a) we already ran PlanDevices before lowering so we are not allowing
 *    any new cross-device copies, but b) after lowering we may have new memory scope constraits
 *    to deal with.
 *
 * Phase 1
 * -------
 * We flow constraints from the "on_device" and "device_copy" calls, PrimFunc buffer memory scopes,
 * and some special ops, to all other Relay sub-expressions.
 *
 * For a primitive such as \code add(e1, e2) \endcode all arguments and results must be on the
 * same device. However each call site can use a different device. In other words primitives are
 * 'device polymorphic' since we compile and execute them for each required device. ADT constructors
 * are similarly polymorphic, but require all constructor args to be on the same device.
 *
 * For most Relay expressions the device for the overall expression is the same as the device
 * for its sub-expressions. E.g. each field of a tuple must be on the same device as the tuple
 * itself, the condition and arms of an \p if must all be on the same device as the overall \p if,
 * and so on.
 *
 * Some special ops (or 'dialects') are handled:
 *  - Relay supports computing the shape of tensors and operators at runtime using "shape_of"
 *    and "reshape_tensor". Shapes must only be held on the CPU, but the tensors they describe
 *    may reside on any device.
 *  - Explicit memory allocation is done using the "alloc_storage" and "alloc_tensor". Again
 *    shapes reside on the CPU, but the allocated tensors may reside on any device.
 *
 * Two Relay expression have special handling:
 *  - For \code let x = e1; e2 \endcode the result of \p e2 must be on the same device as the
 *    overall let. However the result of \p e1 may be on a different device.
 *  - For a function \code fn(x, y) { body } \endcode the result of the function must be on the
 *    same device as \p body. However parameters \p x and \p may be on different devices, even
 *    different from each other. Every call to the function must use the same choice of parameter
 *    and result devices -- there is no 'device polymorphism' for Relay functions.
 *
 * Currently \p PrimFuncs and external functions do not carry over their parameter and result
 * devices from their original Relay Function representations. However we know all calls to those
 * functions are device-consistent, thus no information is lost.
 *
 * Phase 2
 * -------
 * After flowing constraints we apply some defaulting heuristics (using a global default \p SEScope)
 * to fix the device for any as-yet unconstrained sub-expressions.
 *  - Unconstrained function result devices default to the global default device.
 *  - Unconstrained function parameters devices default to the device for the function result.
 *  - Unconstrained let-bound expression devices default to the device for the overall let.
 * TODO(mbs): These are very simple minded heuristics, and ultimately we'd like to treat the
 * assignment of the remaining unconstrained sub-expressions as an optimiziation problem in itself.
 * This requires a formal notion of 'choicepoint' inside the compiler which can integrate with
 * automation.
 *
 * Phase 3
 * -------
 * Finally, the result of this analysis is reified into the result as:
 *  - Additional "param_se_scopes" (an \p Array<SEScope>) and "result_se_scope" (an \p SEScope)
 *    attributes for every function (both top-level and local). These describe the devices for
 *    the function's parameters and the result.
 *  - Additional "device_copy" CallNodes where a copy is required in order to respect the
 *    intent of the original "on_device" CallNodes.
 *  - Additional "on_device" CallNodes where the device type of an expression is not trivially
 *    implied by the lexically enclosing "on_device" CallNode or function attribute. In practice
 *    this means "on_device" CallNodes may appear in two places:
 *     - On let-bound expressions. It is tempting to elide the "on_device" if the let-bound value
 *       has the same device as the overall let expression. However this would mean passes which
 *       inline let-bound values, such as FoldConstant and DeadCodeElimination, would need to us
 *       a DeviceAware visitor which in turn requires the expression to be in ANF to avoid
 *       deep recursion. To minimize disruption we always include the "on_device" so that it
 *       can follow the inline.
 *     - On a call argument if its device differs from the call result. In particular, the
 *       argument to a "device_copy" call will always be wrapped in an "on_device". (That may
 *       seem pedantic but simplifies downstream handling.)
 *    However since we make it easy to track devices for variables we never wrap an "on_device"
 *    around a var or global var. These uses of "on_device" imply both the argument and result are
 *    on the same device. We signal this by setting the 'is_fixed' OnDeviceAttrs field to true,
 *    which helps make this pass idempotent.
 *  - The buffer maps for called PrimFuncs are updated to capture memory scopes.
 *
 * Helper visitors (in device_aware_visitors.h) can be used by downstream transforms to recover
 * the device for any expression for their own use, e.g. during memory planning. All downstream
 * passes must preserve the lexical scoping of the "on_device" CallNodes. E.g. conversion
 * to ANF must respect the lexical scoping convention:
 * \code
 *   f(on_device(g(h(a, b), c), se_scope=CPU))
 *   ==>
 *   let %x0 = on_device(h(a, b), se_scope=CPU)
 *   let %x1 = on_device(g(%x0), se_scope=CPU)
 *   f(on_device(%x1, se_scope=CPU))
 * \endcode
 *
 * This pass can be run before FuseOps so that it can use device-specific fusion rules.
 *
 * 'Stored on' vs 'Executes on'
 * ----------------------------
 * Obviously for a primitive call \code add(x, y) \endcode we can execute the primitive on the
 * same device as will hold its result. Thus 'executes on' is the same as 'stored on' for
 * primitives.
 *
 * But what about for arbitrary Relay expressions? Most backends (interpreter, graph, VM) are
 * implicitly executed on the 'host' CPU, with only primitive evaluation handed off to specific
 * devices, thus the notion of 'executes on' is mute. AOT backends on the other hand need to
 * know exactly which device (possibly one of a number of available 'CPU'-like devices) is
 * responsible for execution. Currently that's handled independently by the \p AnnotateTargets
 * pass, but we'd like to fold that into device planning here to ensure everything is consistent.
 *
 * Obviously since tensors are passed-by-pointer it's quite possible to execute a Relay
 * expression (eg an \p if expression) on one device even though the tensor data resides on
 * another. But for AOT that flexibility seems excessive. So we'd like to just take 'executes on'
 * to be 'stored on' exactly. In particular, for a Relay function, we'd like to be able to just
 * compile the function body for the function's result device.
 *
 * This works after conversion to ANF provided the compilation for a let expression is prepared
 * to make a cross-device call. However we leave it to a downstream transformation to heuristically
 * minimize cross-device calls by moving device copies out of functions. E.g.:
 * \code
 *   def @f() {  // execute on CPU
 *     let x = on_device(...GPU computation..., se_scope=GPU);
 *     device_copy(...GPU computation..., src_dev_type=GPU, dst_dev_type=CPU)
 *   }
 *   def @main() {
 *     ... call @f() on CPU ...
 *   }
 * \endcode
 * could be rewritten to:
 * \code
 *   def @f() {  // execute on GPU
 *     let x = ...GPU computation...;
 *     ...GPU computation...
 *   }
 *   def @main() {
 *     let x = device_copy(@f(), src_dev_type=GPU, dst_dev_type=CPU)
 *     ... use x on CPU ...
 *   }
 * \endcode
 *
 * Higher-order shenanigans
 * ------------------------
 * Relay is a 'mostly' higher-order language -- we can let-bind functions, pass functions
 * as arguments (even anonymous functions), return functions, evaluate conditional expressions
 * over functions, and so on. We handle this during constraint solving using the domain:
 * \code
 *   D  ::= <specific device type>   -- first-order
 *        | fn(D,...,D):D            -- higher-order
 * \endcode
 * In this way we can determine the device for all function parameters and results. E.g. for
 * \code
 *   let f = fn(x, y) { ... }
 *   let g = fn(f, z) { f(z, z) }
 *   g(f, on_device(..., se_scope=CPU))
 * \endcode
 * the parameters \p x and \p y will be on the CPU.
 *
 * But now look closely at the call \code e1(e2, e3) \endcode. We know \p e1 must evaluate to a
 * function. Our analysis must guarantee that the function's parameters and result devices are
 * consistent for \p e2, \p e3, and the context of the call. But:
 *  - Which device holds the closure result of evaluating \p e1 ?
 *  - If \p e2 is of function type, what does that mean when we say every function parameter
 *    is on a device?
 *  - If \p e1 returns a function, what does that mean when we say every function result is
 *    on a device?
 *
 * Since higher-order aspects are later compiled away (by 'defunctionalization'
 * aka 'firstification') we'd prefer not to have to answer any of those questions. In particular,
 * we really don't want our domain \p D to allow for yet another device for the function closure.
 * So we'll just force the 'device for a function' to be the same as the device for the function's
 * result using the notion of the 'result domain' for a domain:
 * \code
 *   result_domain(<specific device type>) = <specific device type>
 *   result_domain(fn(D1,...,Dn):Dr)       = result_domain(Dr)
 * \endcode
 *
 * Similarly the domain does not have entries for tuples, references, or ADTs. Whenever the
 * analysis encounters a function inside one of those it simply forces all argument and result
 * devices for the function to match the device for the first-order expression. For example,
 * if the tuple \code (fn(x, y) { ... }, 3) \endcode is on the GPU then the inner function
 * parameters and result must similarly be on the GPU.
 *
 * -------
 * | AOR |  This pass supports all of Relay.
 * -------
 *    ^
 *    |
 *    `-- Mark's stamp of completeness :-)
 *
 * TODO(mbs): Proper diagnostics for unification failure using spans.
 * TODO(mbs): We may want some 'device polymorphism' for Relay functions. Eg it's ok for the
 * function to be called with params/result on different (virtual) device ids provided the target
 * and memory scopes are consistent.

 * \brief Inserts missing "device_copy" CallNodes, and ensures the device type of every

 *
 * - Discard any existing "on_device" CallNodes since their job is done. Similarly, discard
 *   any existing "device_copy" CallNodes which are no-ops.
 *
 * - Functions are given "param_se_scopes" and "result_se_scope" attributes to capture
 *   the device type for its parameters and result.
 *
 * - Additional "device_copy" CallNodes are inserted wherever there's a transition between
 *   storage device types. Since the DeviceAnalyzer phase succeeded this can only happen
 *   where the original program explicitly allowed a transition using an "on_device" CallNode.
 *   That is, we do not not try to 'fix' a program with inconsistent devices.
 *
 * - Additional "on_device" CallNodes are inserted so that a later transform can discover
 *   the device for an arbitrary sub-expression by looking only for the lexically enclosing
 *   "on_device" CallNode or "on_device" function attribute. In particular, since function
 *   arguments and let-bound expressions can be on a device different from the function
 *   or let body itself we will insert "on_device" CallNodes to spell out any differences. This
 *   applies even to the argument to a "device_copy" CallNode, which may look pedantic but
 *   keeps downstream processing simple. The "on_device" calls should be removed before code gen,
 *   which is easily done on-the-fly.
 *
 * - Update memory scopes in PrimFunc buffer maps.
 *
 * For example, we'll end up with programs that look like:
 * \code
 *   def @main(%x, %y, param_se_scopes=[...], result_se_scope=...) {
 *     let %a = on_device(..., se_scope=..., is_fixed=True)
